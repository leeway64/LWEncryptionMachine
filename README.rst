===================

This project is based on `Assessment 3 <https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/21su/assessments/a3/>`_
for `UW Seattle CSE 142 (summer 2020) <https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/21su/>`_.
The assignment was originally meant to be completed in Java, but I completed it in C.
